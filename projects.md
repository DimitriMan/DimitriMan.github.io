**Post shock forecasting of seasonal time series** (ongoing)<br>
Proposed a framework for post-shock forecasting in sales/revenue data; applied Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables; incorporated trajectory similarity measures and intercept correction to improve sales and revenue forecasts.

**Morgan Stanley Buffered PLUS contracts valuation**<br>
Priced Morgan Stanley’s Buffered PLUS structured product by modeling swap rates, futures prices, and zero-coupon bonds; implemented European option pricing and implied volatility estimation using the Black–Scholes framework; evaluated hedging strategies using delta and gamma (Greeks)

**Analyzing the Small Business Administration (SBA) loan dataset**<br>
Analyzed the SBA loan dataset to model loan approval and default probabilities; applied generalized linear models, Poisson regression, and logistic regression; performed model selection using information criteria, conducted diagnostics, and generated predictive insights.

**Unsupervised Learning: Matrix completion**<br>
Applied and compared several models—including KNN, user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, SVD, and KNN+SVD—to impute missing values in a rating matrix; evaluated model performance and generated insights on prediction accuracy.

**Comparing the performance of basketball players across eras**<br>
Modeled and compared player performance across different basketball eras; applied response variable transformations and linear mixed models; conducted diagnostics and generated predictive performance metrics.
