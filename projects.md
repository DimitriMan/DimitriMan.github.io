**Morgan Stanley Buffered PLUS contracts valuation** (FIN 512)<br>
Priced Morgan Stanley’s Buffered PLUS structured product by modeling swap rates, futures prices, and zero-coupon bonds; implemented European option pricing and implied volatility estimation using the Black–Scholes framework; evaluated hedging strategies using delta and gamma (Greeks)<br>

**Analyzing the Small Business Administration (SBA) loan dataset** (STAT 528)<br>
Analyzed the SBA loan dataset to model loan approval and default probabilities; applied generalized linear models, Poisson regression, and logistic regression; performed model selection using information criteria, conducted diagnostics, and generated predictive insights.<br>

**Unsupervised Learning: Matrix completion** (STAT 542)<br>
Applied and compared several models, including KNN, user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, SVD, and KNN+SVD, to impute missing values in a rating matrix; evaluated model performance and generated insights on prediction accuracy.<br>

**Comparing the performance of basketball players across eras** (STAT 528)<br>
Modeled and compared player performance across different basketball eras; applied response variable transformations and linear mixed models; conducted diagnostics and generated predictive performance metrics.<br>
