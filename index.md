# About Me

Hi, I’m Dimitrios Mandravelis, a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. My primary research focuses on time series analysis and forecasting, with broader interests in predictive modeling and quantitative research. In particular, I explore applications of statistical modeling and time series forecasting in financial markets, risk management, and investment strategies. 

Currently, I am working on post-shock forecasting of seasonal time series, using intercept correction techniques constructed from a ranked donor pool of similar past shocks. This framework is applied to a real data example aiming to predict the impact of Travis Scott in the quarterly revenue of Nike's after the day he released his co-created shoes, Air Force 1 X Travis, in December 2017.
