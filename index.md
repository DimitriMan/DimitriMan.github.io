# Research Interest

I am interested in data analysis, predictive modeling, and quantitative research, with a focus on
time series forecasting, statistical modeling, and their applications in financial markets, risk
management, and investment strategies.

# Education

**Ph.D.**, in Statistics *2022 – 2027*<br>
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaing 

**M.S.**, in Statistics *2020 – 2022*<br>
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki

**B.S.**, in Mathematics  *2016 – 2020*<br>

# Projects

**Post shock forecasting of seasonal time series** (ongoing)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed a framework for post-shock forecasting in sales/revenue data; applied Seasonal
&nbsp;&nbsp;ARIMA with exogenous variables; incorporated trajectory similarity measures and intercept
&nbsp;&nbsp;correction to improve sales and revenue forecasts.
  
**Morgan Stanley Buffered PLUS contracts valuation** (Spring 2023)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Priced Morgan Stanley’s Buffered PLUS structured product by modeling swap rates, futures
&nbsp;&nbsp;prices, and zero-coupon bonds; implemented European option pricing and implied volatility
&nbsp;&nbsp;estimation using the Black–Scholes framework; evaluated hedging strategies using delta and
&nbsp;&nbsp;gamma (Greeks)
  
**Analyzing the Small Business Administration (SBA) loan dataset**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzed the SBA loan dataset to model loan approval and default probabilities; applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;generalized linear models, Poisson regression, and logistic regression; performed model
&nbsp;&nbsp;selection using information criteria, conducted diagnostics, and generated predictive insights.
  
**Unsupervised Learning: Matrix completion**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keywords: comparison of several models, including KNN, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative &nbsp;&nbsp;filtering, SVD, and KNN+SVD, to impute missing values in a rating matrix. 

# Teaching Experience
