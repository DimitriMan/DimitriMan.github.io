# Research Interest

I am interested in data analysis, predictive modeling, and quantitative research, with a focus on
time series forecasting, statistical modeling, and their applications in financial markets, risk
management, and investment strategies.

# Projects

- **[Post shock forecasting of seasonal time series]** (ongoing)
  Proposed a framework for post-shock forecasting in sales/revenue data; applied Seasonal
  ARIMA with exogenous variables; incorporated trajectory similarity measures and intercept
  correction to improve sales and revenue forecasts.
