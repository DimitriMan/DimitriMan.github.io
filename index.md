# Research Interest

I am interested in data analysis, predictive modeling, and quantitative research, with a focus on
time series forecasting, statistical modeling, and their applications in financial markets, risk
management, and investment strategies.

# Projects

**Post shock forecasting of seasonal time series** (ongoing)<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
Proposed a framework for post-shock forecasting in sales/revenue data; applied Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables; incorporated trajectory similarity measures and intercept correction to improve sales and revenue forecasts.
</p>
  
**Morgan Stanley Buffered PLUS contracts valuation** (Spring 2023)<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
Priced Morgan Stanley’s Buffered PLUS structured product by modeling swap rates, futures prices, and zero-coupon bonds; implemented European option pricing and implied volatility estimation using the Black–Scholes framework; evaluated hedging strategies using delta and gamma (Greeks)
</p>
  
**Analyzing the Small Business Administration (SBA) loan dataset**<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
Analyzed the SBA loan dataset to model loan approval and default probabilities; applied generalized linear models, Poisson regression, and logistic regression; performed model selection using information criteria, conducted diagnostics, and generated predictive insights.
</p>
  
**Unsupervised Learning: Matrix completion**<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
Keywords: comparison of several models, including KNN, user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, SVD, and KNN+SVD, to impute missing values in a rating matrix. 
</p>
