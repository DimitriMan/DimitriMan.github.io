# Research Interests
<hr style="margin-top:0.05em; margin-bottom:1em;">

I am interested in data analysis, predictive modeling, and quantitative research, with a focus on
time series forecasting, statistical modeling, and their applications in financial markets, risk
management, and investment strategies.

**Post shock forecasting of seasonal time series** (ongoing)
<span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
Proposed a framework for post-shock forecasting in sales/revenue data; applied Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables; incorporated trajectory similarity measures and intercept correction to improve sales and revenue forecasts.
</span>

**Morgan Stanley Buffered PLUS contracts valuation**
<span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
Priced Morgan Stanley’s Buffered PLUS structured product by modeling swap rates, futures prices, and zero-coupon bonds; implemented European option pricing and implied volatility estimation using the Black–Scholes framework; evaluated hedging strategies using delta and gamma (Greeks) 
</span>
  
**Analyzing the Small Business Administration (SBA) loan dataset**
<span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
Analyzed the SBA loan dataset to model loan approval and default probabilities; applied generalized linear models, Poisson regression, and logistic regression; performed model selection using information criteria, conducted diagnostics, and generated predictive insights.</span>
  
**Unsupervised Learning: Matrix completion**
<span style="display:block; margin-left:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;">
Applied and compared several models—including KNN, user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, SVD, and KNN+SVD—to impute missing values in a rating matrix; evaluated model performance and generated insights on prediction accuracy.
